Arduino
======

This branch has a simple vocation. Just to take care of all arduino projects written to control a part of the printer.

Each code, act as testing, and then a final version will be a mix of all of these script.

The Arduino project name refers to what's inside. I will not add readme in those directories. 

Don't forget that, this is a "testing" branch and final version will be pushed to the master branch.
