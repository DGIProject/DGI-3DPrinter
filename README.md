DGI-3DPrinter
=============

This README is a bit useless, because all is in the name. 
We are making a 3D Printer, and all of our work will be pushed here.

This project came from the death of a standard printer, and our idea was to use as many as possible parts of this inkJet printer to build a new one. But not a standard printer. A 3D PRINTER. 

We know that this is a big challenge, but this is something completly possible. 
As we started from scratch, we have to develop the arduino firmware and also mecanism of the printer, and the control that goes with it.

We made multiple branch for every parts of this project, such as Arduino Code, thought, gh-pages, ...
All branch except gh-pages are for testing purpose. When something like the arduino code will be stable, it will be pushed to the master branch. 

If you see nothing in this branch for the moment, it is normal, we are currently working on the core, and it is not ready yet.
